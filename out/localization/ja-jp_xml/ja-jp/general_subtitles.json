        "@subtitles_pve_short_sunken_hughes_09": "Okay, so these Strafers were exposing human subjects to Red Salt—well, that part was pretty obvious…<br>But what's interesting is that, for some reason, they didn't expect the subjects to turn.<br>I'm getting numerous records of some 'Essence of Trial' being injected directly in the bloodstream.<br>This must be what they did to Kioni! Oh, Doctor Velasquez owes you a treat!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_escape_hughes_01": "All right, people, the Chosen is gone, but I'm afraid this isn’t over.<br>The Strafers have called in reinforcements, and your only route to extraction is back through that wretched base. Let's go!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_escape_hughes_02": "The Strafers have activated force barriers to keep you inside the perimeter.<br>Clear the facility, and you'll be able to switch these barriers off.",

        "@subtitles_pve_short_escape_hughes_04": "All clear… ah, but the helipad is wired!<br>It'll blow our shuttle to pieces if we try to land.<br>Team, you must head over to the original LZ!",

        "@subtitles_pve_short_bastion_hughes_07": "Whoa! That stuff surely looks different…<br>Team, we've got to take this cargo home. Dispatching a Thunderbird, two minutes ETA.",

        "@subtitles_pve_short_bastion_hughes_10": "Guys, the Thunderbird has arrived! Let's use it for air support!<br>Find a comm station, connect to the UAV, and you'll be able to direct the air strikes manually!",

        "@subtitles_pve_short_bastion_hughes_12": "Team, they have broken through the gate! Protect the cargo!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_bastion_hughes_13": "Ah… they are destroying the container!",

        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_01": "Team, the Strafers have deployed one of their electromagnetic coils on this island.<br>These coils are designed to facilitate the growth of Crystalline constructs.<br>To disable this effect, we'll need to turn off the positive polarity nodes, and preserve the negative ones. I'd best explain it on the go.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_02": "Okay, let's start with the one on the roof of the central building.<br>Get up there and switch that node off!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_03": "Nice work! Now the opposite negative node began attracting the Zone's attention.<br>Head over to it and protect it from Glasshead assault.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_04": "There's our node! Don't let the Glassheads destroy it!",

        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_06": "Doing great, team! I've marked the next positive node on your radar. Expect Strafer resistance!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_07": "This one's off! Marvelous! Now hurry to the opposite negative node!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_08": "All right, you know the drill. Keep the Glassheads away from the node!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_09": "Excellent work! There is only one more node to disable, and we'll short-circuit this hellish device!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_starfall_hughes_10": "You've done it, team! The coil is officially sabotaged.<br>These Strafers will think twice before setting up something like this again.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_01": "Okay, team. Let's take a closer look on that Crystalline Core you've blown up earlier.<br>Call on the scanner drone when you reach the spot. And, as always, beware of Glassheads!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_02": "Aha! So it turned into one of those… Transmutators, or whatever the Doc is calling them.<br>You've dealt with their kind before, haven't you? The trick is to put down the runners before they reach the Core.<br>If you let a runner through, you've got yourselves an Adamant!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_03": "All right, the little bee is working. Give it some time.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_04": "We've collected the data! That was… fairly easy.<br>Now, the hard part will be getting you out of the Zone. A sandstorm is rapidly approaching from the east.<br>I'm going to guide you to the nearest comm station, but be ready to fight your way through.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_05": "Careful! These corridors are swarming with glass hounds!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_06": "Ah, so the Strafers have reinforced their outpost. Clear them out and make your way to the gate!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_07": "Okay, team. The sandstorm has caught up with you.<br>The comm station is not far, but the visibility is limited. Proceed with caution!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_08": "Guys, don't be an easy target for those snipers! Take one step at a time!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_09": "There's the comm station! Clear it of the enemy forces!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_10": "Okay, we have a signal. Dispatching the Bronto, ETA three minutes! Hold on!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_backstab_hughes_11": "Excellent work, team! Hop on. Let's get you out of this wretched place!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_01": "Hey, team! Doctor Velasquez wants to track down a so-called interdimensional bubble.<br>A rare anomaly that has something to do with the Red Realm.<br>I was lucky to catch one on my radar, not far from here.<br>Let's see what the fuss is about, shall we?",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_02": "Well, I can see why they call it a bubble…<br>The doctor's notes here say that these things don't last long.<br>Follow the anomaly. We need to take a peek through its membrane.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_03": "Ah, it's clearly weakening, guys. The membrane is all but invisible…",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_04": "And the bubble is gone. Couldn't get much readings from it… but guess what?<br>I think we can use a Strafer device in the nearby tunnel to summon another one!<br>We'll have to clear their hideout first, though. Let's get on to it!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_05": "Here it is, the Strafer hideout.<br>Your path lies towards the abandoned metro station.<br>Beware: they've called in reinforcements.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_06": "Nice work so far! Now, onto the fun part. There is an electromagnetic field generator on the station ahead.<br>Once active, it will attract every Glasshead in these tunnels, so you'll have to defend it for a minute or so.<br>Then, if my theory is correct, we'll get ourselves a brand new bubble! Let's give it a shot!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_07": "Good, the generator is working. Keep it safe, team!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_08": "Ha! We did it, people. You are now inside the interdimensional bubble!<br>Try to keep up with it while I gather data from your environment sensors.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_09": "Guys, I'm receiving loads of sweet data!<br>Tell the science team they owe you a month-worth supply of pizza, no less!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_10": "The bubble has nearly evaporated! Just a few more readings, hang on!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_cybtrail_hughes_11": "Excellent work here, team! Now we know how to conjure these bubbles at will.<br>Might come in handy in our Red Realm investigations… Prep for evac.<br>Always a pleasure guiding you on these missions.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_01": "Team, something very strange is happening around the crash site of our stratospheric vessel.<br>We are getting signs of an elecrtomagnetic disturbance, atypical for the regular Crystalline.<br>It pains me to return here… but we must investigate.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_02": "Ah, mierda! Of course, those wretched Chosen are involved. Who else could that be…<br>Team, I need you to peek inside that portal and bring me a sample of whatever you find there!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_03": "Is this some… pocket dimension? Astonishing! Grab a sample of that purple crystal and bring it to the storage bin.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_04": "Guys, protect the gateway while your teammate is inside!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_05": "Another rift detected! Go for it!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_06": "One more rift on my sensors! Ah, this Chosen must be toying with us!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_07": "Nice work here, team. Me and my people will get to the bottom of this purple strain. Now, these Strafers are based in the nearby mountain pass.<br>How about we drop by and say hello? By which, of course, I mean raze their operation to the ground!<br>And if you happen to encounter that Chosen fellow, please make it clear to him that we will not tolerate his dancing on our people's bones!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_08": "There! Huh. Smart fortification, I'm sure the Commander would have given it credit…<br>But no matter! Get up there, team, and leave no stone unturned!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_09": "You've cleared this snake den… Great job. Proceed to the exit, but beware of those nasty glass flies.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_10": "What in the name of goodness are these Chosen up to? Commanding the crystal?<br>Bending it to their will? As if the alien plague itself wasn't enough…",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_11": "So, this coward won't even fight us? Don't worry, we'll get to him and his lackeys soon enough.<br>Now cut these Stilts down to size, and let's be done with it…",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_12": "Those lightning rods are healing the creatures! Turn them off!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_twins_velasquez_13": "Excellent work, people. Evac shuttle is on approach. Commander and I will have a serious talk.<br>We need a plan how to deal with these Chosen once and for all!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_01": "You saw who?! Impossible! He's been…<br>Team, I need you to report everything you've seen and heard up to this moment!<br>Every last bit, understood? We gotta get you out of there first, though.<br>I'm taking a bird. Rendez-vous in ten minutes! Over.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_02": "Team, I'm headed your way. Don't know what kind of wasp nest you've poked, but it's striking lightning bolts all over the place.<br>Here's the rendezvous coordinates. Get you asses over there and make it quick!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_03": "The cavalry has arrived!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_04": "Damn storm! I can't land here, need a high ground.<br>Head over to the city ruins. I'll try to clear the path for you.",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_05": "Okay, I'm at the ruins. No storm here, but I detect a Strafer platoon rapidly approaching. Hurry up!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_06": "How do you like this, motherfuckers? Ha-ha, just like old times!<br>Team, I'm gonna pick you up once the landing is clear!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_07": "You goddamn lunatics! How many more of you do we got to kill? Let's deal with this last batch, fellas!",
        "@subtitles_pve_short_quicksand_phillips_08": "Finally, a clear landing spot. Get in, people!<br>I want to see your reports on my table as soon as we get to base!"
